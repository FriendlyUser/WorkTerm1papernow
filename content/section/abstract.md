> Dear Susan, Please accept the accompanying Work Term Report entitled
*Determining uses of and at MOTI IMB.*

> This report is the result of work completed at the Ministry of
Transportation and Infrastructure Information Management Branch,
Government of British Columbia. During my first work term as a
University of Victoria student, I used charts and tables to display
information about , complied documentation for critical applications in
a and researched add-ons to extend functionality. In the course of work,
I gained exposure to a technical environment, and learned how software
can integrate together.

> Through the course of the term, I was given the opportunity to learn
much software development, testing applications, and software products.
I feel that this knowledge will be helpful in future work terms, and in
my career.

> I would like to thank my manager, Phillip, for his patience and
good judgement, as well as the Client Services who were always willing
to help. 

Sincerely, David Li
