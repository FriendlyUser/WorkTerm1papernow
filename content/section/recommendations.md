Even though JIRA and Confluence are powerful software tools, failing to
grasp the full capabilities limits what can be done. Potential uses of
JIRA include issue management, project management and lengthy daily
activities that require documentation. Although there are multiple
issues types at this time, clear definitions for these issues and when
to use them are missing. Adding a wider range of types will allow JIRA
to be for a wider range of problems. Also, users are inconsistent in
their use of JIRA, failing to include details, documents or work
offline. Increasing understanding of how it works and guidance on when
to use it needed. Creating business rules on how and when to use JIRA
and Confluence will improve documentation consistency. Confluence should
be configured to support day to day JIRA activities at MOTI IMB.
Furthermore, research into the plethora of add-ons available for JIRA
and Confluence to see what functionality can be added.
